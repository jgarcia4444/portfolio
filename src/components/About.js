                        <strong>Education:</strong> I first started to teach myself with multiple free online resources such as Codecademy and Youtube to learn the basics of web development. This included learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. Once i felt that I needed to learn more to be able to grasp enough knowledge to really start building projects I then started to buy books and courses on Udemy. I had been "teaching" myself how to code for about a year and a half and then in the month of September 2019 I enrolled in a fundamentals of full stack web development bootcamp at the University of Redlands about an hour away from where I live. Through this course it made the knowledge I had already gained through the multitude of free resources online more concrete because I got the chance to help other students who were coming into the course with no previous knowledge of coding.

                <div className="four columns">
                    <p>
                    After completing this bootcamp I still felt that I had more to learn before attempting to work for a big time company. I found an online bootcamp after researching and looking at many other options offered by Flatiron School based out of New York City. This bootcamp was a self paced online full stack web development course that went into way more detail than the previous bootcamp I completed. This second boot camp taught me modern frameworks that are used to build reponsive, fast and reliable web apps.

                    <p>
                    I looked for a more rigorous bootcamp and ended up applying for and after an interview process was accepted into Flatironâ€™s Self Paced Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I am currently towards the end of the program and love what I have learned so far. React has gotten me to start developing a few small projects because with React web apps can be functional in a short amount of time. I will continue to create web apps, better my skills, further my knowledge, and try to network with like minded people.<b>If anyone has an idea for a web app or iOS app I am open for freelance work.</b>
